# me_WifiShip -- ArduinoIDE library

## Overview

Esplora WiFi API wrapper.

  - [x] Get/set MAC
  - [x] Scan
  - [x] Connect to router
  - [x] Get IP

Do it with style! I love space games (Elite, KSP), so imagine
your WiFi module is _ship_ (base type is _craft_). It has _name_ (SSID)
and _id_ (MAC). It can scan space for _stations_ (routers) to _dock_
(connect) with them.
